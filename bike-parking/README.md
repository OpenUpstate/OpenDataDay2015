# Greenville, SC Area Bike Parking

[Bikeville](http://bikeville.org/) is the [City of Greenville](http://greenvillesc.org/)'s bicycle friendly community initiative.

And they built this [map of Bike Parking](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=zb33lA0lekoE.kwPGd8aWi_zk&msa=0)!

And @bigbluehat made it a [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org) file via [geojson.io](http://geojson.io). Then uploaded to a [Socrata Open Data Portal](https://brigades.opendatanetwork.com/LAND-USE/Bicycle-Parking-Greenville-SC/x8qd-77mi?firstRun=true) to see how that worked.

## TODO
* [x] Make it a GeoJSON file
* [ ] Do something cool with it
